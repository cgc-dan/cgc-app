The Webpack plugin allows you to use standard Webpack tooling to compile both your main process code and your renderer process code with built in support forHot Module Reloading in the renderer process and support for multiple renderers.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @electron-forge/plugin-webpack --dev
```

## Basic Usage

### Configuration

You must provide two webpack config files, one for the main process in `mainConfig` and one for the renderer process' in `renderer.config`. See an example below:

The complete config options are available at [`WebpackPluginConfig`](https://js.electronforge.io/plugin/webpack/interfaces/webpackpluginconfig.html) 

```javascript
{
  plugins: [
    ['@electron-forge/plugin-webpack', {
      mainConfig: './webpack.main.config.js',
      renderer: {
        config: './webpack.renderer.config.js',
        entryPoints: [{
          html: './src/renderer/index.html',
          js: './src/renderer/index.js',
          name: 'main_window'
        }]
      }
    }]
  ]
}
```

### Project Setup

You need to do two things in your project files as well in order to make this plugin work.

First, your `main` entry in your `package.json` file needs to point at `"./.webpack/main"` like so:



```javascript
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "main": "./.webpack/main",
  ...
}
```



Secondly, all `loadUrl` and `preload` paths need to reference the magical globals that this plugin will define for you for each of your entry points.  For an entry point with the name `main_window` two variables will be defined `MAIN_WINDOW_WEBPACK_ENTRY` and `MAIN_WINDOW_PRELOAD_WEBPACK_ENTRY` , this point to the paths for your renderer entry point and your preload script path respectively.  An example is given below.

{% code-tabs %}

```javascript
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  webPreferences: {
    preload: MAIN_WINDOW_PRELOAD_WEBPACK_ENTRY,
  }
});

mainWindow.loadUrl(MAIN_WINDOW_WEBPACK_ENTRY);
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Hot Reloading

All your renderer processes in development will have hot reloading enabled by default, it is unfortunately impossible to do hot module reloading inside a renderer preload script, WebWorker or for the main process itself.  However Webpack is constantly watching and recompiling those files so to get updates for preload scripts simply reload the window, and for the main process just type "rs" in the console you launched `electron-forge` from and we will restart your app for you with the new main process code.

## What happens in production?

In theory, you shouldn't need to care.  In development we spin up `webpack-dev-server` instances to power your renderer processes, in prod we just build the static files.  Assuming you use the globals we explained in [Project Setup](webpack.md#project-setup), everything should Just Work\(tm\) when your app is packaged.

## How do I do virtual routing?

If you want to use something like [`react-router`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) to do virtual routing in your app you will need to ensure you use a history method that is not based on the browser history APIs.  Browser history will work in development but not in production as your code will be loaded from the filesystem not a webserver.  In the `react-router` case you should use the [`MemoryRouter`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router/docs/api/MemoryRouter.md) to make everything work.
